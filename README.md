- 👋 Hi, I’m @jullanggit
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux & Rust
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever seems interesting to me (again, mostly Rust & Linux)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can get my hands on :)
- 📫 How to reach me: via email (jullanggit@proton.me) or any other way you can find
- Fun fact: ALL of my code is written with minimal help from generative AI, following the [brain made](https://brainmade.org/) philosophy
